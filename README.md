.emacs.d
========

This is my .emacs.d directory.  This repository mitigates my pain when setting up new
environments, but I invite anyone/everyone to steal anything/everything useful in it...

Note that the .emacs file usually lives in my home directory (I just soft link to the 
version in .emacs.d).
